# Playing *Herd Mentality* via this app

This app can be used to facilitate games of Herd Mentality, both remotely and in-person, if you do not have access to your physical copy of the game.

## Setup
1. One player needs to **host**, and set up a new game
2. All other players need to **join**, using the game code or join link
3. The host can start the game when all players have joined

## Round play

### Question approval

At the start of a round, a new question is drawn automatically.

The host can choose to draw a new question, or accept the one shown.

### Answer submission

Once the host has accepted a question, all players (including the host) can privately submit their answers to the question.

*When you submit an answer, you cannot edit it* (a design decision made to facilitate quick gameplay). 

### Mark allocation

When all players have submitted answers, they get publicly revealed.

The host then allocates marks and the Pink Cow based on the answers.

*(This is not done automatically, since there is an element of human judgement in whether answers 'count' as the same thing.)*
