# Can you _think like the herd_?

> ðŸŽ¯ **Win by having the most points** - and collect the most points by being the best at predicting the most common answers to questions. But **don't get the pink cow**, as you can't win when you have it!

Big Potato Games has produced a great video explainer, which you can view below:
[![Herd Mentality explainer video]({explainer-thumbnail.jpg})]({https://youtu.be/_rxOJ7Gt3FY} "How to play Herd Mentality")

For a text summary, you can read on.

## Round structure and scoring

Herd Mentality is a game based around **rounds**.

Every round has a **question** - such as, *What's the best flavour of crisps?*.

Then, all **players write down answers** privately and independently, trying to write down what the most common answer will be.

After this, **all answers are revealed**.

There are three outcomes for players:
- **Herd (1 point):** If there is a *single* most common answer, every single player who gave that answer scores one point.
- **Neutral (0 points):** If a player did not write down the single most common answer, they score no points.
- **Pink Cow (special status):** If there is exactly one player who didn't share an answer with anybody else, they take the *Pink Cow*. (We'll explain this more soon.)

## Pink Cow

You cannot win if you have the Pink Cow - even if you have the most points.

However, there is *only ever one Pink Cow* - so you can lose it if, in a later round, somebody has to take it from you.


## Handling ties
- Players only score points if there is a *single* most common answer - in cases of ties, nobody scores points.
- There can only be one Pink Cow - in cases where 2+ players have answers that aren't shared by anybody else, then neither has to take the Pink Cow.

### Examples

Let's suppose we're playing with 4 players and the question is, _"Name a type of juice"_.

- If the answers collected are `"Orange"`, `"Orange"`, `"Apple"`, `"Carrot"`, then the 2 "Orange" players are both in the Herd and score a point. There is no Pink Cow answer, since *both* "Orange" and "Carrot" are unshared answers.
- If the answers collected are `"Orange"`, `"Orange"`, `"Orange"`, `"Apple"`, then the 3 "Orange" players are all in the Herd and score a point. The "Apple" player is the Pink Cow, and has to take it from whichever player last had the Pink Cow.
- If the answers collected are `"Orange"`, `"Orange"`, `"Apple"`, `"Apple"`, then there is no Herd, because "Orange" and "Apple" are tied. There is also no Pink Cow answer, since no answers are unshared.

## Game end

After a round is scored, the game continues to a new round, until there is a winning player.

A player wins if they satisfy the below:
- They don't have the Pink Cow
- They have the highest score (ignoring the Pink Cow player, whose score doesn't count)
- They have 8+ points
- There is nobody tied with them  (ignoring the Pink Cow player, who cannot win)
